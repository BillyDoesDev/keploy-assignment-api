## The Warehouse
**Version:** 0.0.1

[![Run Tests](https://github.com/BillyDoesDev/keploy-assignment-api/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BillyDoesDev/keploy-assignment-api/actions/workflows/test.yaml)


The Warehouse API helps you do... well, a bunch of random stuff!
For starters, feel free to check out the endpoints we provide:

### /students
Allows you to perform basic CRUD operations on a database - you may **search/create/update/delete** student records.

This section connects the app to a [MonboDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) Database, using docker. Persistence in data is ensured through named volumes. Additionally, [DbDate](https://dbgate.org/) is used to monitor and interact with the database.

### /weather
Get the weather for a particular region, courtesy of https://wttr.in
<hr>

### /apod
Gets the Astronomy Picture of the Day, courtesy of [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/).
<hr>

### /xkcd
Get an XKCD comic.
<hr>


## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system, since that's what we use to set up our databases.

Clone the reposiroy, `cd` into it and simply start up the containers!
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BillyDoesDev/keploy-assignment-api.git
cd keploy-assignment-api
docker compose up --build -d
```

You may then view your server logs using:
```sh
docker logs -f fastapi
```

And that's it! üöÄ 

**You can access the API documentation over at http://localhost:8000/scalar.</br>**

> Beautiful and robust API docs, powered by [Scalar](https://www.scalar.com)

*Optionally, you could also check the docs using the default swagger UI on http://localhost:8000/docs.*

In either of the endpoints, you will find elaborate API documentation, along with a playground to test them out. Regardless, this repository contains the basic overview to help you get started.

## Testing

All tests have been written under the `tests/` directory. It covers all basic test cases, such as:
- [x] Unit tests (mocking, logic)
- [x] Integration (database logic)
- [x] API coverage (endpoints, response validation)


Tests are automatically run on every push, and on every pull request. 
In order to test it out yourself, you could do so via the docker container you've spun up:
```sh
docker exec fastapi sh -c "pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && sh run-tests.sh
```
